HowLong
=======

It's a simple mac toolbar app that alerts you how long you have left before you hit 30 years in age. A gentle reminder for myself that time does not wait for you and to not spend all day on reddit. At some point, I'd like to make a physical clock that counts down the number of hours till you hit 30 using giant seven segment LCDs, but that's a project for another day. A little bit of detail on why exactly this might be important is up on my [blog](http://tejaswi-yerukalapudi.com/2012/09/10/a-countdown-timer-for-your-life/).
